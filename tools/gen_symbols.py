"""
Generates the symbol table the firmware lends to dynamic apps.

It reads the build's static libraries and emits
components/aos_dynapp/aos_symbols.c with one entry per global symbol. That way
an external app can call LVGL, the HAL and the UI runtime as if it had been
compiled inside the firmware.

Usage:
    idf.py build                 # first pass, so the .a files exist
    python3 tools/gen_symbols.py
    idf.py build                 # second pass, now with the table

With --libs you can widen or narrow which libraries are exported.
