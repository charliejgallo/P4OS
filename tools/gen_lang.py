"""Extract translatable strings and check language packs.

Spanish is the source language and the catalog key is the Spanish string
itself, so there is nothing to invent: this walks the sources for `_("...")`
and for the app names the launcher translates, and writes one template per
catalog.

    python3 tools/gen_lang.py template en      write /lang/en templates, keeping
                                               any translations already there
    python3 tools/gen_lang.py check en         what the pack is missing, and
                                               what it has that the code lost
    python3 tools/gen_lang.py stats            how much of the UI is marked up

Packs live in `lang/<code>/` at the root of the repo by default, tracked in
git (sim/sim_fs is not). `tools/install_lang.sh <host> <code>` puts them on the
card's `/lang/` through the portal, and `tools/install_lang.sh sim <code>`
copies them to `sim/sim_fs/lang/`, which is where the simulator looks. The
pseudo-locale (`pseudo xx`) lands in `lang/xx/`, which is not tracked: it is
regenerated from the sources in one command. Use --out to write somewhere
else.

Where a string ends up
----------------------
`_sistema.lang`   everything under components/aos_ui and components/aos_apps,
                  plus EVERY app's `desc.name`, built-in and dynamic alike.
                  App names have to live here: the launcher draws "Gemas"
                  without having opened Gemas, so that app's own catalog is
                  not loaded yet.
<app id>.lang     `_()` inside apps/<dir>/main, filed under the app's
                  `desc.id` ("demo.2043"), which is what the runtime uses to
                  find the catalog.

The escaping
------------
Keys are written exactly as they appear between the quotes in the C source -
`\\n` stays two characters on the page. That is deliberate and it has to match
what the loader does: the C compiler turns `_("Ene\\nFeb")` into a string with
a real newline, and a line-oriented catalog cannot hold one, so the file keeps
the escaped form and `unescape()` in aos_i18n.c undoes it before hashing. Get
this wrong in either direction and multi-line strings miss every lookup in
silence.
