 * card is an app of its own in the launcher, with its name and its icon, and
 * the number of them is only known on the watch.
 *
 * Both are OPTIONAL and the ABI does not move for them. A .so without them
 * loads exactly as before -that is the 26 apps of today, untouched- and a .so
 * WITH them still works on a firmware that has never heard of them, because
 * AOS_APP_ENTRY_MANY also defines the old aos_app_init() as index 0. That is
 * why the index is not the identity: on reopening, a module is asked for the
 * index the loader wrote down, but what the app IS must be decided from
 * self->desc.id, which the runtime keeps and which does not move when a file
 * appears on the card.
