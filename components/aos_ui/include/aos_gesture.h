/*
 * AmoledOS - gestures: tap, double tap, long press, drag with fling, and
 * two-finger pinch.
 *
 * The v2's touch chip reports two fingers (docs/GESTURES.md tells how that
 * was found), but it does it badly in ways that have to be filtered: the
 * second finger drops out for up to a second, the first one jumps to garbage
 * as a finger lifts, and on one diagonal the X of the two fingers get
 * swapped. This recogniser eats all of that and hands the app clean events,
 * so no app has to learn the chip.
 *
 *     static void on_gesture(const aos_gesture_event_t *ev, void *user)
 *     {
 *         switch (ev->type) {
 *         case AOS_GESTURE_DRAG:  rotate(ev->dx, ev->dy);          break;
 *         case AOS_GESTURE_PINCH: zoom_at(ev->scale, ev->x, ev->y); break;
 *         default: break;
 *         }
 *     }
 *     aos_gesture_attach(area, 0, on_gesture, me);
 *
 * What the app must know:
 *
 *  - Events arrive in the LVGL task, from a timer: the callback may touch
 *    LVGL, and may delete the object it is attached to (the recogniser goes
 *    with it).
 *  - The chip sends ~73 samples a second and every one becomes an event, so
 *    DRAG and PINCH can come several per LVGL frame: accumulate them into a
 *    target and draw once per frame (easing towards it hides the odd gap).
 *  - Attaching makes the object clickable, NOT scrollable and not chained to
 *    a scrollable parent, and it only listens to touches that START on that
 *    object. An app that pinches
 *    wants AOS_APP_FLAG_NO_SWIPE and AOS_APP_FLAG_LONG_DRAG too: otherwise the
 *    global back gesture fires on a drag and aborts the touch (aos_app.h).
 *  - After two fingers, a touch never turns back into a drag: the pinch lasts
 *    until every finger is up. Lifting one finger mid-pinch is where the chip
 *    reports garbage, and a model that spins by itself when you let go of a
 *    zoom is worse than one that waits.
 *  - Scale and centre are safe against the chip's swapped diagonal (they do
 *    not depend on which X goes with which Y); a two-finger ROTATION would
 *    not be, and that is why there is none.

 * Fingers, one by one (for on-screen game pads)
 *
 * A pinch cares about two fingers together; a pad cares about each finger
 * on its own: one on the stick, the other on FIRE, pressing and lifting
 * independently. aos_touch_points() hands out the fingers that are down with
 * an id that stays with each finger while it stays down, and the same
 * filtering of the chip as the pinch:
 *
 *  - a second finger counts after two samples (the first can be bogus);
 *  - a finger that vanishes for one sample is kept (up to ~120 ms): the
 *    chip drops the second finger now and then, and a FIRE that flickers
 *    off is worse than one that lifts a sample late;
 *  - a finger that jumps more than ~110 px in one sample is held where it
 *    was for that sample: that is the garbage sample of a finger lifting,
 *    and if the next sample agrees it is a different finger (new id).
 *
 * Pairing: with the two fingers at about the same height (a pad along the
 * bottom) the points are clean; on the ↗↙ diagonal the chip can swap their
 * X (docs/GESTURES.md), so a pad should keep its controls level.
 *
 * Call it from the LVGL task (a timer, the app's frame); it reads the
 * latest sample and only does work when there is a new one. Screen pixels.
