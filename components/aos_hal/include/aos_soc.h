/*
 * AmoledOS - The battery's state of charge, estimated by the firmware.
 *
 * Why this exists: the AXP2101's own gauge uses a generic battery model and
 * does not know this cell. On 2026-09-25 it read 49 % and 65 % the two times
 * the watch ran flat (the recharge afterwards took as long as one from
 * empty), and it jumps to 100 % the moment the charger finishes. The chip
 * cannot measure current, so the estimate is built from what it can:
 *
 *   - At rest (screen not lit for 30 s, no audio) the voltage is close to
 *     the open-circuit voltage, and a lithium cell's OCV maps to its charge.
 *   - With the screen lit the voltage sags under the load. How much is
 *     learned on the watch: every time the screen is lit from rest, the
 *     voltage before and 20 s after are compared.
 *   - While charging, the current IS known in the constant-current phase
 *     (it is what the firmware programmed), so charge is counted in; the
 *     constant-voltage tail is approached smoothly and "done" is 100 %.
 *   - A full charge that started low measures the capacity: charge counted
 *     in, over the fraction of the cell it filled.
 *
 * Pure C, no IDF: it builds on the Mac too (tools/soc/soc_bench.c).
