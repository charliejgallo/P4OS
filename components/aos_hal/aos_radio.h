/*
 * AmoledOS - an internet radio as a source of MP3 bytes.
 *
 * Internal to the HAL, shared between the board and the simulator like
 * aos_http.c. One station at a time: a reader (a task on the board, a
 * thread on the Mac) keeps the connection, follows redirects and playlists,
 * takes the ICY metadata out of the stream and leaves the audio in a ring
 * of bytes in PSRAM; the player's decoder drinks from the ring through
 * aos_radio_read(), which never blocks. A dropped connection is retried by
 * the reader on its own, and the decoder only notices a pause.
 *
 * What the app sees of all this is aos_hal_radio_*() in aos_hal.h.
