/*
 * AmoledOS - Network survey
 *
 * A background task sweeps the WiFi networks around, then our own LAN (which
 * addresses answer and with what MAC) and then the TCP ports of whatever it
 * found. It writes an NDJSON report to the microSD as it works.
 *
 * The app only looks at totals (aos_hal_scan_status). The detail is read from
 * the portal, which serves the file verbatim: the firmware does not interpret
 * the format, just as with 'remoto's profile.
 *
 * The four decisions inside it, with their reasons:
 *
 *  1. ONE SINGLE RAW ICMP SOCKET, not esp_ping. esp_ping creates a task per
 *     session: 254 sequential sessions with a 300 ms wait is 76 seconds.
 *     Sending the 254 echo requests back to back and listening afterwards, the
 *     whole sweep is a couple of seconds.
 *  2. THE MACs COME FROM THE ARP TABLE, and they have to be harvested WHILE
 *     sweeping: ARP_TABLE_SIZE is 10 entries (fixed in lwip/opt.h, not a
 *     Kconfig), so waiting until the end means finding it overwritten twenty
 *     times. This is also what finds the ones that do NOT answer ping but do
 *     answer ARP, which in a house is half of them.
 *  3. THE ARP TABLE IS READ FROM THE lwIP THREAD, with tcpip_callback_wait().
 *     CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING is not set, so reading arp_table from
 *     this task would be a race against the thread that writes it. Since
 *     tcpip_callback_wait() blocks the caller until the callback finishes,
 *     there is no race over our own table either.
 *  4. RANGE GUARD. Only our own subnet and only if the prefix is /24 or
 *     smaller. Without that, this is not a scanner of your house: it is a
 *     scanner.

 * assert(esp_task_stack_is_sane_cache_disabled()) in
 * spi_flash_disable_interrupts_caches_and_other_cpu(), under an NVS read. The

 * flash: a flash operation turns the cache off, and with it PSRAM, stack
 * included. Borrowing the radio does touch the flash -the wifi preference is
 * NVS, and esp_wifi_init/start read the PHY calibration from NVS- so it cannot
 * run there.
 *

/* LAN sweep: ARP first, ICMP as a bonus.
 *
 * MEASURED ON THE BOARD, and that is why it is written this way. The first
 * version sent 253 echo requests back to back, with 4 ms between them, and
 * trusted the stack to resolve each destination's ARP on its own. The log said
 * what was really happening: "253 sent (0 failed), 6 ICMP replies, 1 ARP
 * entry", and from one run to the next 6, 1, 2, 1, 5. In other words, an
 * unrepeatable disaster.
 *
 * Two things were wrong:
 *
 *  1. sendto() RETURNING SUCCESS DOES NOT MEAN THE PACKET WENT OUT. Every new
 *     destination needs an ARP resolution and the packet sits queued waiting
 *     for it. With 253 different destinations in one second, an ARP table of
 *     10 entries and a small packet queue, the stack evicts entries and drops
 *     the queued packets without saying anything. Most of those 253 never
 *     reached the wire.
 *  2. ON A LAN, ARP FINDS MORE THAN ICMP. A host may have its firewall closed
 *     to ping —Windows ships that way— but it CANNOT stop answering who has
 *     such-and-such an address: without that it could not use the network.
 *     That is why serious LAN scanners sweep by ARP.
 *
 * Now ARP is requested explicitly with etharp_request(), eight addresses at a
 * time, and the table is harvested before the next batch: eight is fewer than
 * the ten entries, so nothing is overwritten. The ICMP goes in the same batch
 * and is left as extra data: it distinguishes "answers ping" from "ARP only".

     * on finishing-, so sending it outside does not raise the floor of free
     * internal RAM by a single byte. What it avoids is the PEAK: its 5 KB came
     * out of internal RAM exactly when internal RAM is tightest, which is with
     * WiFi up, buffers in flight and sockets open, that is, precisely during a
     * sweep. And latency is all the same to it: it spends its life waiting on
     * network timeouts, so PSRAM's cache tax goes unnoticed.
     *
     * THE PRICE, and it is not optional: this task must NEVER reach the flash
     * -no NVS, no preferences, no esp_wifi_init/start, no SPIFFS, no OTA-.
     * A flash operation turns the cache off and PSRAM with it, stack
     * included, and the driver asserts (esp_task_stack_is_sane_cache_disabled,
     * docs/RAM-AUDIT.md 6.4). It bit on 2026-09-25: borrowing the radio for
     * the network scan read the wifi preference from here and the watch
     * rebooted. Anything that needs the flash goes to a short task with an
     * internal stack, like radio_job_task above.
     *
     * NOTE: a task created with xTaskCreateWithCaps MUST be deleted with
     * vTaskDeleteWithCaps, or the stack is not freed. Those are the two exits
