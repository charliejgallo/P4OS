/*
 * P4OS (from AmoledOS) - Apple Media Service, the part that does not talk to NimBLE.
 *
 * Pure assembling and disassembling of bytes, without NimBLE and without
 * ESP-IDF, so it can be tested on the Mac with tools/ams_harness.c. Same
 * division of labour as aos_ancs.c.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS PHASE'S RULE, and it comes first because it governs the rest:
 *
 *   **Notifications are worth more than music control.** If AMS interferes
 *   with ANCS, AMS leaves the device.
 *
 * Three decisions follow from that, and they are not matters of style:
 *
 *   1. AMS is the LAST link of the discovery chain. Everything ANCS needs is
 *      already subscribed before this starts, so if AMS fails at any step, it
 *      takes nothing with it.
 *   2. **It does not subscribe unless the user asks.** It starts off and is
 *      switched on from the BT Control app. Taking it off the air is a tap,
 *      not a recompilation.
 *   3. **Nothing that changes often is requested.** Of the track, the title,
 *      artist, album and duration are requested; of the player, the state and
 *      the app's name -which only changes when you change player-. The VOLUME
 *      is not requested: it changes every time somebody touches the button on
 *      the side of the phone. And neither is the track POSITION: it arrives
 *      inside the state when something changes and the watch goes on counting
 *      it by itself. Asking for it would be one notification a second
 *      competing for the air with the real notifications.
