/*
 * NEON SNAKES - the sprites, drawn by code
 *
 * Nothing here is a bitmap. Every fruit and every part of a snake is a short
 * list of shapes (discs, capsules, cones, ellipses, arcs) in CELL units, and
 * one function turns a list into RGB565 at whatever size a cell has: 24 px in
 * the normal mode, 18 in combat (the watch's were 16 and 10), and whatever fits when the screen turns in
 * the middle of a game or a two-device match brings the watch's arena. The
 * same drawing serves them all, which a hand-drawn 16x16 would not.
 *
 * The look comes from the distance to each shape: inside, the colour going
 * to white at the core the way a neon tube does; at the edge, a
 * one-pixel antialiased rim; outside, a glow that fades over half a cell.
 * The background is black - every pixel of it, always - so the glow can be
 * baked into the sprite and the compositor can combine sprites by taking the
 * brighter of each channel, which is what light does anyway: a glow over a
 * glow looks right and costs no alpha.
 *
 * A sprite is 2x2 cells with its cell in the middle, so its glow reaches half
 * a cell into each neighbour and never further. That bound is what lets the
 * compositor repaint a cell from its 3x3 neighbourhood alone (ns_draw.c).
