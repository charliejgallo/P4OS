/*
 * CHATARRA - turn-based robot RPG
 *
 * The game's model. Nothing here knows LVGL, the HAL or the preferences exist:
 * that all lives in chatarra.c, as in cjump and arkanos. That way the world,
 * the combat and the workshop can be tested without a screen.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE RULE THAT ORDERED THE WHOLE DESIGN, AND WHAT IS LEFT OF IT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This file used to open by saying that .text was the scarce resource: dynamic
 * apps took their code from a 48 KB reservation shared by every loaded app,
 * while their .rodata went to PSRAM, which is eight megabytes. One line of
 * code cost eight bytes of a pool; one kilobyte of table cost nothing.
 *
 * THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE. Since v0.3.4 (docs/RAM-AUDIT.md section 8) the
 * loader maps the apps' .text into PSRAM through the instruction-bus MMU:
 * the reservation is gone, the general executable heap got the 48 KB back,
 * and the games were measured at the same frame rate on both builds - Claude
 * Jump 29.2 against 29.0 fps, with run-to-run noise larger than the
 * difference. This app's code went from 38 KB to 49 KB in one update without
 * anything to weigh it against.
 *
 * The three decisions it produced are still here, and they are still right -
 * for reasons that were never about the pool:
 *
 *   1. The 64 robot parts are NOT 64 sprites or 64 functions. They are 64
 *      DESCRIPTORS of a handful of bytes and four drawing functions that
 *      interpret them (ch_parts.c). The colour goes in as an argument, like
 *      cjump's costumes. What that buys now is that a part is a ROW: adding
 *      one is a line of a table, and every part can be drawn at two scales, in
 *      the register, as a silhouette and inside a whole robot without any of
 *      those knowing how a leg is shaped.
 *   2. The maps, the dialogue, the items and the attacks are const tables.
 *      Adding a whole town adds not one line of code - and, more to the point,
 *      not one line of code that can be wrong. ch_map_check() can walk a table
 *      and find a door on a wall; it could not walk a function.
 *   3. Whatever is drawn the same is drawn by the same function. A sign, a
 *      chest and an NPC go through the same blit.
 *
 * What the change does mean is that a fourth rule has quietly expired: "do not
 * write that, it costs .text". It does not, any more. What things still cost
 * is being understood, and that budget was always the tighter one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SCREEN (P4OS)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The watch had a 184x224 buffer: the map on top, a HUD below it that could
 * not be touched, and a menu opened by the physical button or by touching
 * your own robot. On the P4 the whole 5" glass is touchable and there is no
 * button, so the game fills the OS's retro canvas (360x640 standing up,
 * 640x360 lying down, shown x2) with two layers:
 *
 *     the world   the room at 2, 3 or 4 canvas pixels per unit - the player
 *                 pinches between them - seen through a window that follows
 *                 the player when the room is bigger than the window;
 *     the UI      in UI units of 2x2 canvas pixels: the watch's coordinates,
 *                 twice as big. The HUD (with a MENU button now) sits under
 *                 the map standing up and beside it lying down; the menus,
 *                 the combat and the booth are laid out for the room they
 *                 get, which is `ch_lay` below.
 *
 * Everything the game knows about where things are on the glass is in
 * `ch_lay`; chatarra.c fills it for the orientation it was given.

 * v2: THE ZOOM IS FREE, AND THIS IS WHY
 *
 * The engine draws into a 184x224 buffer and expands it x2 to the panel in the
 * last step. The zoom is NOT done by growing the buffer -that would multiply
 * every dirty rectangle by four and cost the combat seven frames a second- it
 * is done by growing the TILE inside the same buffer.
 *
 *                          v1 (TILE 8)      v2 (TILE 12)
 *     buffer               184 x 224        the same
 *     expansion            x2               the same
 *     cells on screen      23 x 22          15 x 14
 *     a cell, on the panel 16 x 16 px       24 x 24 px
 *     art per tile         64 px            144 px   (2.25x the detail)
 *     the whole background 32,384 px        30,240 px
 *
 * The background comes out CHEAPER, not dearer: fewer tiles, each one bigger.
 * Nothing in ch_pixel.c, in the dirty rectangles, in present() or in the
 * combat changes - the combat never used TILE, and its robots already draw
 * from descriptors with a scale argument.
 *
 * The whole cost of v2 is art and level design. docs/internal/HANDOFF-CHATARRA-V2.md
 *
 * P4OS: the buffer is gone (see "THE SCREEN" above) and the zoom is the
 * PLAYER's now, with two fingers - but it is still done by drawing the same
 * 12-unit cell bigger, never by drawing more of them: the rooms are still
 * 15 x 14, and that is what every door, table and quest was written for.
