/*
 * CHATARRA - the world
 *
 * Cells, decorations, rooms, entities and dialogue. All of this is .rodata,
 * that is, PSRAM, that is, free: adding a whole town adds not one line of code
 * and not one byte to the 48 KB reservation. It is why the world is described
 * with tables and not with functions.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ROOM
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The world is split into rooms of ONE screen: 23 x 22 cells of 8 px. The
 * camera never moves. That is not a limitation that was accepted: it is what
 * makes the game run at 30 fps on this board. With a moving camera the 165
 * thousand pixels would have to be upscaled and invalidated on every frame
 * -the 15 fps measured in 2043- and the whole dirty-rectangle technique falls
 * apart.
 *
 * A room is three things:
 *
 *   suelo   ROWS rows of COLS characters. Each character is a cell and is
 *           drawn with an 8x8 pattern from the table below.
 *   props   large decorations -trees, houses, machines- painted INTO the
 *           background, occupying several cells.
 *   ents    what can be touched: characters, chests, doors, signs, enemies.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE GRASS'S VARIATION HAS TO BE DETERMINISTIC
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The grass and the earth alternate between two patterns according to the
 * cell, so they are not stamped. That choice is made with a function of the
 * coordinate and NOT with the random number generator. The reason is the
 * engine: the background is restored by rectangles every time something moves
 * over it, so grass rolled on the fly would give a different picture on every
 * repaint and the map would "boil" under the player. It is the same reason
 * arkanos's stars are in a table.

 * EDGE TILES: WHERE ONE GROUND SPILLS OVER ANOTHER
 *
 * Until now grass met a path in a perfectly straight step eight pixels long,
 * and a map made of those reads as a spreadsheet with a robot on it. What
 * fixes that is not more tiles: it is that the two terrains OVERLAP by two or
 * three pixels, raggedly, wherever they touch.
 *
 * Two decisions keep it cheap and keep the tables small:
 *
 *   1. ONE pattern per terrain, written for its NORTH edge, and the other
 *      three sides are that pattern TURNED (borde_dibujar below). Twelve
 *      patterns per terrain -four sides, four outer and four inner corners-
 *      is what a full autotiler needs and it is why most of them are
 *      generated rather than drawn. One and a rotation is a tenth of the art
 *      and, at eight pixels, looks the same.
 *
 *   2. It is drawn ONCE, into the background, when the room is built. It is
 *      the same licence the combat arena has: the background is the one place
 *      in this engine where detail costs nothing per frame.
 *
 * Which terrain spills over which is a PRIORITY, not a special case: grass
 * grows over a path, sand lies on stone, snow covers everything. The one that
 * matters most is the lowest - water and lava have priority zero, so whatever
 * surrounds a pond hangs into it, which is what gives a pond a shore instead
 * of a rim.

 * IS THERE ANYTHING DRAWN ON TOP OF THIS CELL?
 *
 * Props and entities are painted INTO THE BACKGROUND, on top of the ground.
 * The flowing water repaints its own cells into the frame buffer, and a cell
 * that has a sign standing on it gets the sign wiped - and then restored from
 * the background on the next frame, and wiped again on that run's next turn.
 * On the board that reads as a sign blinking at the edge of the pond, which is
 * exactly what it was.
 *
 * So the runs stop at anything that covers them. A few tiles of water under a
 * sign do not ripple; nobody can tell, and it is a great deal better than the
 * blinking.
 *
 * The box of an entity is taken from what ch_ent_draw() actually blits, and
 * not from a generous envelope around it. That is not fussiness: a three-by-
 * three box around the sign at the edge of the first town's pond swallowed six
 * of its twelve cells and half the pond stopped moving. The sign is fourteen
 * pixels tall drawn six above its cell, so it covers two rows, not three.
