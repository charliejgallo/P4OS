/*
 * MAPAS - one decoded vector tile.
 *
 * OpenFreeMap serves OpenMapTiles vector tiles (Mapbox Vector Tile, protobuf).
 * mp_mvt_decode() keeps only what the map draws, already sorted by drawing
 * class, so the renderer walks the classes in order across every tile on the
 * screen (roads of one tile over the water of the next) without sorting.
 *
 * Coordinates stay as the tile has them: int16, 0..extent (4096), plus the
 * buffer the tile carries past its edges. The renderer turns them into
 * screen pixels with one multiply and one add.
