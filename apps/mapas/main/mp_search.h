/*
 * MAPAS - search: the names of the downloaded zones, and Photon online.
 *
 * Every offline zone brings an index, <card>/maps/<zone>.idx, written by
 * AmoledOS's portal page /mapas or its tools/map_pack.py (whose write_idx()
 * documents the AIX2 format; P4OS has neither yet, README): one 9-byte key per word of every name, sorted, and a table
 * with the first key of every 256. A search loads that table, reads only the
 * keys that start with the query's longest word, and then the few names it
 * needs: a few reads, however big the city. The first version's text index
 * (one line per name, read whole: ~1 s per 450 KB on the board) is still
 * read if found.
 *
 * Online, Photon (komoot's geocoder over OpenStreetMap) answers streets with
 * their numbers, which the offline index does not have. The request is the
 * app's (LVGL's side, like every HAL request); mp_search_photon() only reads
 * the answer.
