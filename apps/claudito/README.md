A virtual pet for AmoledOS, with the Claude Code critter inside. Hand-drawn
pixel art, two scenes, and eight ways to make it happy.

## On P4OS

This is the watch game moved onto the P4OS retro canvas
([`docs/RETRO.md`](../../docs/RETRO.md)), and stretched to the whole screen.

- **One canvas, the whole screen.** 90x160 art pixels x8 = 720x1280 in
  portrait, 160x90 x8 = 1280x720 in landscape. x8 is the biggest factor at
  which the watch's 92-column scene still fits across 720 px; it loses one
  column on each side, where nothing lives. Everything is a third bigger than
  the first port's x6, and nothing is letterboxed.
- **The layers.** HUD, stage and bar are rectangles of that one canvas. The
  HUD and the bar are presented with `aos_retro_present_rect()` only when
  they are dirty.
- **Only what changed.** The stage is redrawn into the canvas every frame,
  but only what differs from the screen is presented. The rectangles drawn
  over the background this frame or the last (the critter, its toy, the
  bubble, the particles, the scene's clouds and stars) are compared row by
  row with a copy of the canvas as last presented, and only the rows that
  changed go, cut to their columns and gathered into bands. The HUD and the
  bar, when redrawn, go the same way: a gauge moving presents the gauge. An
  idle critter presents ~1 % of the stage a frame (it was ~20 % presenting
  everything drawn over the background, and all of it before that);
  playing, ~6 % where it was ~32 %. `CLAUDITO_VERIFY=1` (simulator) checks
  it: after every present it counts the stage pixels that differ from what
  was presented, and logs the presented share every 70 frames.
- **Night is baked.** The night version of each scene (a night sky with the
  moon and still stars, the ground darkened towards blue, the lamp lit) is
  drawn once into the cached background, instead of darkening the whole
  stage on every frame. Only a few twinkling stars and the fireflies move.
- **The art at x8.** Every art pixel is a visible block, so surfaces go in
  steps: a lit and a shaded side, bands of colour meeting through a row of
  checkerboard dither, the light from the top left. The room has curtains,
  a clock, a fringed rug and planks in their own tones. The yard has far
  hills, a bush and flowers in the grass. The sprites keep the watch's sizes,
  with an outline and a highlight each.

  | | portrait | landscape |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | HUD | 90x30 on top: name, day, the bars two by two | 52x90 on the left: name, day under it, the bars one under the other |
  | stage | 90x106 | 90x90 in the middle |
  | bar | 90x24 at the bottom, buttons 14x18 | 18x90 on the right, buttons 14x14 |

- **The stage keeps the watch's frame.** Every position in the scenes and in
  the game's logic is still on the watch's 92x78 stage. A `cl_buf_t` has a
  stride and an origin, and the origin places that frame inside the taller
  stage: 18 rows down in portrait, 8 in landscape. Above it there is more wall
  (with a cornice and, in portrait, a string of pennants) or more sky; below
  it, more floor or grass. The tray hangs from the top of the stage.
- **Both orientations.** The app asks for neither orientation flag. It lays
  itself out for the root it gets, and turning the screen recreates it. The
  state is in the preferences, so a sleeping critter stays asleep.
- **Touch only.** The board has no motion sensor and no buttons: everything
  is a tap or a drag. The finger goes through LVGL hit areas on a transparent
  object exactly over the canvas, at the art positions x the canvas's scale.
  `AOS_RETRO_TOUCH` is not used.
- **Back and home.** The system's edge gestures work. They are drags that
  start on the edge (left 28 px, bottom 36 px), and a rub starts on the
  critter.
- **The pace.** The OS's fixed tick at 14 steps a second, where the watch's
  frame was 70 ms. The pet's needs follow the wall clock.
- **Preferences.** The same `pet_*` keys, and the same strings.

The description below is the watch's, where the grid was 92x112 shown x4.

## How it is put together

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cl_pixel.[ch]` | RGB565 buffers, primitives, ASCII sprites and the 5x7 font |
| `cl_pet.[ch]` | the character in parts: body, legs, arms, eyes and mouth |
| `cl_scene.[ch]` | living room and yard, by day and by night |
| `cl_sprites.[ch]` | food, toys and ornaments, written as ASCII art |
| `claudito.c` | state, interactions, HUD and the frame loop |
| `tools/mkfont.py` | generates the font table from ASCII art |

**The grid is 92x112.** The screen is 368x448, that is, exactly four times
that. All the drawing happens on the small grid and `expand4()` then upscales it
x4 into a buffer at the real size, which is what the canvas sees: LVGL draws it
1:1, scaling nothing, and the 4x4 blocks come out exact.

Three layers and a cache:

```
HUD        92x17    name, day and the four bars          redrawn on change
stage      92x78    background + critter + objects + particles   every frame (70 ms)
bar        92x17    the six buttons                      redrawn on change
background 92x78    the scene drawn once                 memcpy into the stage
```

The cached background is the difference between redrawing the parquet plank by
plank fourteen times a second and copying 14 KB. What moves by itself (clouds,
sun, butterfly) goes on top, in areas where it covers nothing.

The buffers come from `malloc()`, not `lv_malloc()`: the four small ones add up
to ~35 KB and the three upscaled ones to another ~330 KB, whereas LVGL's pool on
the board is 64 KB and it needs that for its own work. `malloc()` with PSRAM has
plenty to spare for blocks of that size.

## Decisions that cost something

**The character is drawn in parts, not as a sprite.** Storing thirty 34x26
bitmaps weighs more and does not let it squash on landing or stretch on jumping.
With body, legs, arms, eyes and mouth parameterised, each new animation is a
couple of fields in `cl_pet_t`.

**The font is generated by a script.** Writing 50 glyphs by hand in hexadecimal
is where the mistakes creep in: `tools/mkfont.py` takes them as ASCII art and
emits the table that goes into `cl_pixel.c`.

**Everything in integers.** The stats go in hundredths and the particles in
sixteenths of a pixel. No floating point: the `.so` leaves not one libm symbol
unresolved (`nm -D -u` gives 44 symbols, all of them in the firmware's table).

**The app asks for `AOS_APP_FLAG_NO_SWIPE` and `AOS_APP_FLAG_LONG_DRAG`.**
Cleaning the critter means dragging your finger, and the runtime's back gesture
fires at 50 px of drag: without the first flag, rubbing its belly would take you
out of the app; without the second, the global `lv_indev_wait_release()` would
cut the rubbing short halfway even though the gesture does nothing. With both,
the app interprets the gesture itself and does nothing while the finger is at
work.

**Leaving does not cancel what it was doing.** The back and home gestures
close the app; they do not wake the critter or take its toy away. The
only thing one step back closes is an open tray, which is not an action but a
half-chosen menu. For that to be true, the mode is stored in the preferences
(`pet_mode`) and restored on opening: if you left it sleeping, you come back and
it is still asleep, with the energy it recovered meanwhile — the time spent
closed is applied at the sleeping rate, not the waking one.

**Leaving is deferred to the timer.** `aos_ui_back()` destroys the app; calling
it from an event callback would destroy it while it runs. It is noted down and
executed at the start of the next frame, which is the first thing `step()` does.

## What you can do

Six buttons along the bottom: eat, play, clean, tickle, sleep and change scene.

- **Eat** opens a tray with an apple, pizza, a biscuit and cake. Each gives
  something different: the cake cheers it up most and dirties it most. Really
  full, it accepts no more.
- **Play** opens another tray: a ball (it bounces and the critter chases it), a
  balloon (tied to its hand, with the string following the swing), bubbles (it
  pops the ones that pass near its head) and blocks (it stacks until the tower
  falls).
- **Clean**: the sponge follows your finger and you have to rub. Foam appears
  and, on finishing, sparkles.
- **Tickle**: touch its belly. It laughs, wriggles and throws hearts.
- **Sleep**: night falls, stars and Zs appear, and it recovers energy.
- **Scene**: living room or yard.

And with no mode active, touching it is a stroke.

**Holding the name down** for about two seconds resets the day counter. A little
yellow bar grows under "CLAUDITO" while you hold, and releasing early does
nothing (it just tells you what it is for). It is counted in frames and not with
`LV_EVENT_LONG_PRESSED` because that threshold belongs to the input device
-global, changing it would affect the whole system- and because this way how
much is left can be drawn.

## State

Four bars (hunger, mood, cleanliness, energy) that fall with real time, even
with the app closed: the clock minute is stored and on opening whatever happened
is applied, clamped to twelve hours. If it is short of something it says so by
itself, and if it is very dirty, flies and blotches appear on it.

The preference keys carry the `pet_` prefix.
