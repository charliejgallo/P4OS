# Radio

*P4OS port of the AmoledOS app.* On the 5" screen the dial, the transport,
the volume and the nine keys share the screen with **the whole list of
stations** (`radio/library.json` from the portal, or the 33 it starts with):
tap a row to tune it, and **hold a key down** while a station plays to store
it there, like a car radio's presets. Lying down it is two panes: the dial
and the transport on the left, the keys and the list on the right. The text
below is the watch's and still holds for everything else.

Internet radio on a front panel from the sixties: nine preset keys with a
lamp each, a lit amber dial with the station, the song, its artist, the
stream's format and the cover, and a red needle that travels over a numbered
scale to the key on air.

*From the watch (AmoledOS); the P4 draws the same dial larger.*

## Using it

| | |
| --- | --- |
| a key | tunes that station. The key on air is pushed in and lit; pressing it again does nothing, like a real one. An empty key says where to fill it |
| ⏮ ⏭ | the previous or next key with a station |
| ▶ ⏸ | pause and resume; with nothing playing, the last key you listened to |
| 🔈 | mute, and back to the volume it had |
| the fader | the volume |
| **i**, or the dial | everything the stream says of itself: the song and its album, what the station calls itself and its genre, format, server, buffer, reconnections, time listening and data received |

The station keeps playing when you leave the app, and the control centre
drives it: its music row shows the song, or the station's name between songs,
and its previous and next walk the same keys.

A pause shorter than the buffer (about 16 s at 96 kbps) resumes where it
stopped; a longer one, more than 20 s, resumes **live**.

## Choosing the stations

On the computer, at `http://<name>.local/radio`, the portal's Radio page:

- **Now on the watch**, with play, pause, previous, next, stop and the volume.
- **The watch's keys**: drag a station from your list onto a key, or a key
  onto another to swap them. Each key can be played or cleared from there.
- **My list**, kept on the card as `radio/library.json`. The first time it
  holds 33 stations checked against the watch's own stream code, 8 of them
  AAC or HLS.
- **Find radios** in radio-browser.info's open directory, by name, country and
  genre. "Only the ones the watch can play" is on by default; with it off, an
  Ogg, FLAC or fMP4 station is marked in red.
- **Add by hand**: a name and a stream address.
- **Album covers**: the switch for the iTunes lookup.

Every station can be heard in the browser (🎧) or tried on the watch (⌚)
without putting it on a key.

## What plays

MP3 and AAC (AAC-LC, HE-AAC and HE-AACv2, since v0.8.1) over `http://` or
`https://`: Icecast, Shoutcast and the big stations' CDNs, following
redirects and `.pls` / `.m3u` playlists; and HLS (`.m3u8`) with MPEG-TS or
packed-audio segments, since v0.8.1. **Ogg, Opus, FLAC, HLS in fMP4 and
encrypted HLS do not play**: the watch refuses them and says why ("Format not
supported: MP3 and AAC only"). The search with "only the ones the watch can
play" leaves them out. The dial shows the codec ("HE-AAC 64 kbps", "AAC HLS").

## The cover

The song's cover comes from the iTunes Search API, looked up by the stream's
"Artist - Title"; it is only used when iTunes' artist matches the title's, so
a jingle does not borrow somebody's record. Without one, the key's logo: the
page draws the station's logo on a 160 px square **in the browser** and saves
it to the card as `radio/logoN.jpg`, so the watch only ever decodes a small
JPEG. With neither, a speaker grille.

What leaves the watch for the cover is "artist title", to Apple. Turn it off
in the page if you would rather not.

## How it is built

The app plays nothing itself. It hands its nine keys to
`aos_hal_radio_play()` and reads back `aos_hal_player_info()` (what is heard)
and `aos_hal_radio_status()` (how the stream is doing) five times a second.
The connection, the ICY titles, the buffer and the decoding are the
firmware's player, the one that plays the card's MP3s: that is why it keeps
playing with the app closed.

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `radio.c` | what the panel does: the keys from NVS (`rad0`..`rad8`, rebuilt when `rad_gen` moves), the transport, the dial's words, the tick |
| `radio_ui.c` | the panel: LVGL objects that stand still, the scale drawn once on an ARGB8888 canvas, the needle moved by a 30 ms timer only while it travels |
| `radio_art.c` | the covers: the iTunes lookup through the HAL's HTTP client, the logos from the card, JPEG to a 160 px square |

It needs firmware **v0.8.0** or later (`aos_hal_radio_*`); AAC and HLS need
v0.8.1. The measurements
(time to sound, CPU, RAM, what a station URL turns out to be) are in
[AmoledOS's docs/RADIO.md](https://github.com/charliejgallo/ESP32S3_AmoledOS/blob/main/docs/RADIO.md).

## In the simulator

The simulator plays the stations for real, through SDL:

```bash
cd sim && cmake --build build -j8
P4_SIM_SCRIPT="wait 800; open aos.radio" ./build/p4os_sim
```

`AOS_SIM_RADIO_MUTE=1` decodes without sound. The keys are read from
`sim/sim_fs/prefs.txt`, which `tools/portal_dev_server.py` writes when you use
the `/radio` page at `http://localhost:8088/radio`.
