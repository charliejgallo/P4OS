/*
 * P4OS - Radio (from AmoledOS): the picture in the dial.
 *
 * Three sources, best first: the cover of the song on air, looked up by its
 * StreamTitle in the iTunes Search API (the only thing that leaves the watch
 * is "artist title"; off with the portal's switch); the station's logo, a
 * 160 px JPEG the portal made in the browser when the station was put on a
 * key (card: radio/logoN.jpg); and, with neither, the drawn one.
 *
 * P4OS: the square is 320 px (the info card shows it at that size and the
 * dial takes it down); iTunes is asked for exactly that, and the 160 px logos
 * are doubled.
