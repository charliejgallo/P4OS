# Golf — 3D assets rendered in Blender

The watch (ESP32-S3, 368x448 AMOLED, RGB565) cannot run a 3D character, so
the golfer and the props are modelled and animated in Blender and rendered to
sprites. The renders are NOT final colours: the golfer comes out as a
**lighting pass** (grey) plus a **region-id pass**, and the watch colours each
pixel with the palette of the skin the player bought in the shop:

    colour = palette[id] shaded by grey

That is what makes skins cost nothing: a red shirt and a blue one are the same
render. Hats are different geometry, so each hat model is its own small layer
rendered with the body as a hold-out (occluded where the body is in front).

Blender 3.3.1 is at `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender`
(Cycles on the M2's Metal GPU works). Everything is **procedural and
re-runnable headless**:

    /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender -b -P golfer.py -- --out ../../assets/render

No hand-made .blend files are the source of truth; a script is.

## World units and the swing camera

Metres. Z up. The ball sits at the origin on the ground (z = 0). The target
is straight ahead along **+Y**. Right-handed golfer: stands on the -X side of
the ball-target line, **facing +X** (towards the ball), left shoulder towards
the target. Feet centre about (-0.75, 0, 0), stance width ~0.45 m along Y.

The swing camera is shared with the watch's 3D renderer, so the golfer lands
exactly on the terrain the watch draws. **Do not change it without telling
the engine side**:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| position | (-0.16, -4.80, 2.82) |
| looks along | +Y, pitched **down 11°** (Blender rotation X = 79°, Y = 0, Z = 0) |
| vertical FOV | 50° (sensor fit VERTICAL) |
| image | 368 x 448, principal point at the centre |

With that camera the feet land around y = 395, the head around y = 235, the
horizon at y ≈ 131 and the ball at x ≈ 200. Render the full 368x448 frame;
the packer crops.

Sun: from behind-left and above the camera (a direction coming from roughly
(-X, -Y), elevation ~50°), slightly warm, plus a soft sky light, so the
golfer's back and right side are lit and the cast shadow falls forward-right.

## Passes, per frame

All PNGs at 368x448 (or the turntable size), 8-bit:

| file | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `<seq>_<nn>_shade.png` | RGBA. RGB = the lighting on neutral light-grey (0.8) materials: diffuse + a little gloss, soft shadows, ambient occlusion. A = coverage, antialiased. Film transparent, no ground visible. Standard view transform (NOT Filmic), so grey means grey. |
| `<seq>_<nn>_id.png` | L (grey). value = region id x 16 (0 = empty). No antialiasing (pixel filter ~0.01 px), so every pixel is exactly one region. Must cover at least every pixel the shade pass covers with alpha > 0. |
| `<seq>_<nn>_shadow.png` | L. How much the golfer darkens the ground there, 0..255 (a shadow-catcher plane). No golfer pixels in it. |

Hat layers, per hat model k: `hat<k>_<seq>_<nn>_shade.png` and
`hat<k>_<seq>_<nn>_id.png`, same meaning, only the hat, with the golfer's body
held out (hat pixels behind the head or the club do not appear).

The body passes are rendered **without a hat** and with hair.

## Region ids

| id | region | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | empty | |
| 1 | skin | face, neck, ears, forearms if short sleeves, the right hand |
| 2 | hair | short hair; visible under/around the hats and when there is none |
| 3 | shirt A | polo body |
| 4 | shirt B | polo accent: collar, sleeve cuffs, and a pattern (e.g. horizontal stripes on the body) so a skin can be striped or plain (plain = same colour in A and B) |
| 5 | trousers A | |
| 6 | trousers B | a check/tartan pattern (squares), so "plaid trousers" is a palette |
| 7 | shoes A | |
| 8 | shoes B | sole, laces or saddle panel |
| 9 | belt | |
| 10 | glove | left hand |
| 11 | club head | metal |
| 12 | shaft | |
| 13 | grip | |
| 14 | hat A | only in hat layers |
| 15 | hat B | brim, band or pompom, only in hat layers |

## Sequences

1. **`swing`**, 24 frames, swing camera. 0 = address (club behind the ball),
   0..10 the backswing to the top (the watch shows frame = power while the
   meter rises, so they must read as a smooth progression), 11..14 the
   downswing with 14 = impact (club head on the ball), 15..23 the follow-
   through to a held finish. Club: a driver-like wood (shaft ~1.1 m).
2. **`idle`**, 4 frames, swing camera: address with a small waggle / weight
   shift, loops 0-1-2-3-2-1.
3. **`cheer`**, 8 frames, swing camera: after a good shot, turns towards the
   camera a little and pumps a fist, club in the other hand.
4. **`sad`**, 6 frames: head drops, club leaning, hand on hip.
5. **`turn`**, 8 frames, a showcase camera for the shop: standing relaxed with
   the club head resting on the ground, rotated in 45° steps (0 = facing the
   camera, then turning to its left), camera a bit above chest height, whole
   body in a 184 x 280 image with a little margin.

## Metadata

`meta.json` next to the PNGs: per sequence the frame count, image size, and
for `swing` the club head's screen position per frame; for `turn` the feet
baseline.

## Look

Stylised-realistic, like a good mobile golf game: correct adult proportions
(~7.5 heads), smooth shapes (skin modifier + subdivision, metaballs, or sculpted
primitives), clothes that read as clothes (a polo with a collar and sleeves,
trousers with a crease and a belt, a glove, shoes), a readable club. At 160 px
tall every silhouette decision shows: the pose must be beautiful at that size.
Check every change by colouring a preview with a sample palette
(`preview.py`) and LOOKING at it.

## Props (a second script, `props.py`)

Trees and small things for the course, baked in colour (no palette):

| name | what |
| --- | --- |
| `tree_pine`, `tree_oak`, `tree_poplar`, `tree_palm`, `bush` | **side view** for the 3D view (camera pitched down 11° like the swing camera, orthographic, sun from behind-left), 128 px tall for the trees (bush 48), RGBA with alpha, and the trunk base's pixel in meta.json; **top view** for the map (orthographic straight down, sun from the upper-left of the image = north-west), 96 x 96, RGBA, plus a separate `_topshadow.png` (L) of the shadow it casts towards the lower right |
| `flag` | pin and flag, side view, 64 px tall, 4 frames of the flag waving |

Colours for the props: realistic, a little saturated; greens that sit well on
mown grass (the watch's fairway is around #4FA23A, rough #3C7F2C).

## P4OS: `--scale 2`

`golfer.py` and `props.py` take `--scale S` (P4OS renders at 2): the same
cameras and fields of view at S times the pixels, so the swing frame is
736x896 with its principal point at the centre (368, 448), the turntable
368x560, the trees 256 px tall on their side and 192x192 from above, the flag
128 px. The golfer gets one more level of subdivision at render time. The
game places a swing frame by its offset from that centre
(`GF_ART_PPX / GF_ART_PPY`, `main/gf_view3d.h`), and `tools/pack_p4.py`
packs the result as version 2.
