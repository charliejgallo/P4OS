/*
 * TOPOS - game state
 *
 * A whack-a-mole. A lawn full of holes (fifteen upright, ten lying down);
 * moles pop up and you tap them. A mole
 * in a hard hat takes two taps (the first knocks the hat off), a golden one
 * is worth a lot, and a bomb must NOT be tapped.
 *
 * Three modes, all with a difficulty that climbs as you play:
 *
 *   CLASSIC    60 seconds, points and combos.
 *   SURVIVAL   three hearts. A mole that gets away or a bomb costs one;
 *              every eight moles is a level.
 *   FRENZY     30 seconds starting fast, several moles at once, and a combo
 *              multiplier that reaches x5.
 *
 * The file layout is Claude Jump's, and for the same reason -the rules and
 * the drawing are tested without a screen (tools/tp_harness.c)-:
 *
 *   tp_pixel.c   pixel engine and dirty rectangles (from cjump, plus a lip)
 *   tp_art.c     the sprites, rendered once when the app opens
 *   tp_game.c    rules, spawning and difficulty. Neither LVGL nor the HAL.
 *   tp_draw.c    lawn, holes, and the compositor that repaints only what
 *                changed
 *   topos.c      the app: LVGL screens, preferences, touch, timer, sound
 *
 * THE ONLY TEXT ON THE CANVAS IS NUMBERS AND SIGNS. The 5x7 font has no
 * accents; every word is an LVGL label. That is Claude Jump's rule and it is
 * what keeps the catalogues free of transliterations.
