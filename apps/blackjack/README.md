# Blackjack

Blackjack against the house on a green table. Tap chips onto the betting
circle, deal, and play the hand: hit, stand, double or split. The dealer's
hole card turns over when you are done, the dealer draws to 17, and the hand
is paid. The bank is kept between sessions.

## The table's rules

They are the ones printed on the felt, and the usual ones of a six-deck
shoe game:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Shoe | six decks, reshuffled when the cut card (about 75 %) comes out |
| Dealer | stands on every 17, soft ones included |
| Blackjack | pays 3 to 2 |
| Insurance | offered when the dealer shows an ace; pays 2 to 1 |
| Peek | with an ace or a ten up the dealer checks for blackjack, so a dealer blackjack only takes the first bet |
| Double | on any first two cards, also after a split |
| Split | once per round, any two cards of the same value; split aces get one card each, and 21 there is not a blackjack |
| Bets | 10 to 1000, in chips of 10, 50, 100 and 500 |

With these rules basic strategy loses about half a percent, and that is what
the bench measures (below): **0.46 %** over three million hands. The menu has
a **Hint** switch that rings in gold the button basic strategy would press.

If the bank cannot cover the smallest bet, the round-over row offers a new
bank of 1000. Leaving in the middle of a round gives the stakes back: the
round never finished.

## On the P4

The whole 720 x 1280 screen, by touch or with a USB gamepad. Upright: the rail with the
menu and the bank on top, the dealer, the printed band, the player with the
betting circle at his left, and the chips and the buttons at the bottom,
two by two while playing (Pedir and Plantarse in the lower row, nearest the
thumb). Lying down (1280 x 720): the table on the left and every control in
a leather panel on the right. Turning the screen rebuilds the view around
the same game, so a hand in progress survives it. Every target is at least
88 px and clear of the system's edge strips.

With a gamepad the d-pad walks the buttons showing and A presses the
outlined one, which starts on the usual choice (Repartir, Pedir, Otra
mano). B is the second choice (Plantarse, Borrar, No, Apuesta), L doubles,
R splits and START opens and closes the menu. The outline only appears
once the pad is used.

## How it is drawn

The table is one opaque RGB565 canvas drawn once when the app opens -
cloth, rail, gold lines and the curved words, which are written letter by
letter along the arc with the system's fonts (`lv_draw_letter` with a
rotation), so they are translated like everything else.

Every card is an ARGB8888 canvas of its own (172 x 232 with the shadow,
160 KB in PSRAM), drawn once when it is dealt; from then on it is an object that
moves and LVGL repaints only the area it crosses (APP-GUIDE 6.4). The motion
is the app's: its timer moves each card along a tween and turns the hole
card by squeezing its horizontal scale to an edge, changing the face and
opening it again. No `lv_anim`: nothing is left to call back into the app
after it closes, and the one callback that would have been needed,
`lv_anim_set_ready_cb`, is not in the firmware's symbol table.

The art is plain C with no LVGL (`bj_art.c`), so the bench can lay out the
whole deck on a sheet. It is the watch's drawing, number for number, at an
integer scale (`bj_art_set_scale`, x2 on the P4: 152 x 212 cards, 100 px
chips): redrawn at twice the resolution, not enlarged. The table is drawn
straight into RGB565 a pixel at a time (`bj_felt_draw565`), with no 32-bit
copy of the screen on the way:

- **The suits are implicit curves**, sampled 4 x 4 per pixel once per size
  into an alpha mask and tinted. The heart is the classic sextic
  `(x² + y² - 1)³ - x²y³ ≤ 0`; the spade is that heart upside down on a
  flared stem; the club three circles; the diamond a superellipse with
  slightly hollow sides.
- **The indices are a stroke font**: segments and arcs with round caps,
  antialiased by distance, so the same drawing serves the corner of a card
  and the value on a chip.
- **The court cards are pixel art** (`bj_court.c`): half a figure, 23 x 20,
  drawn at x2 of the scale (4 x 4 pixels each on the P4) and turned 180
  degrees for the other half, as on a real deck.
  The king holds a sword, the queen a rose, the jack a halberd; the clothes
  change colour with the suit.
- Whatever a real card prints twice - the index, the lower pips, the figure -
  is drawn once through a transform that turns it, so the halves cannot
  disagree by a pixel.

The icon travels inside the `.so` (`aos_icon_set_ops()`, no firmware
change): a red card's back and an ace of spades, fanned on the cloth.

## The rules engine

`bj_game.c` knows nothing of LVGL or the HAL. An action only queues work;
`bj_step()` does one thing - a card, the reveal, a result - and says what it
did, so the app can animate each card before asking for the next. When
nothing is queued it returns `BJ_EV_NONE` and the game is waiting for the
player.

## The bench

```bash
cc -O2 -I apps/blackjack/main apps/blackjack/tools/bj_harness.c \
   apps/blackjack/main/bj_art.c apps/blackjack/main/bj_court.c \
   apps/blackjack/main/bj_game.c -lm -o /tmp/bjh

/tmp/bjh sheet /tmp/sheet.ppm 1    # the deck, the back, the chips, some piles (x2;
                                   # BJH_K=1 for the watch's size)
/tmp/bjh play 1000000              # a bot plays; checks after every hand
BJH_PURE=1 /tmp/bjh play 3000000   # basic strategy only: the house edge
/tmp/bjh time                      # what each drawing costs on the Mac
```

`play` recomputes every payout from the cards alone and compares it with
what the engine paid and with the bank; checks that the dealer stopped at
17 and not later, that no card came after 21 or on split aces, and that each
fresh shoe has six of every card. A bot plays basic strategy with 2 % of
random moves and insures one time in five, to walk the paths a good player
never takes.

## Development switches

In the simulator (on the board `getenv()` always returns NULL):

```bash
BJ_AUTO=1                   # basic strategy plays by itself, round after round
BJ_SEED=42                  # the same shoe every time
BJ_BANK=5000                # start with that bank
BJ_CARDS=0,12,9,22 BJ_DEAL=1   # the top of the shoe, in dealing order:
                            # player, dealer up, player, hole, then hits
                            # (card = suit*13 + rank; rank 0 is the ace)
BJ_ACTS=psh                 # play these as the game waits (h s d p; y/n insure)
BJ_SCREEN=menu              # open the menu, for the layout audit
BJ_HINT=1                   # the strategy hint on
```

In the P4 simulator, shots go through `P4_SIM_SCRIPT` (`open demo.blackjack;
wait 3000; shot a.png; rotate; ...`).
