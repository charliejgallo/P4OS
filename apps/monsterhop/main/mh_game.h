/*
 * MONSTER HOP - the rules: Tommy, the monsters, the level's things
 *
 * Positions are world metres (a cell's centre is +0.5); Tommy and the
 * monsters live on the grid and move between cell centres, except when
 * something carries them (a log, a platform). Lanes, traps and platforms
 * are functions of the level's clock only, so two watches that started the
 * level together see them in the same place without talking.
