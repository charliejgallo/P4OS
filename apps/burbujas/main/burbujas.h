/*
 * BURBUJAS - game state
 *
 * A bubble shooter. A hexagonal board hangs from the ceiling, the launcher at
 * the bottom throws bubbles at it, and three or more of a colour that end up
 * touching burst; whatever is left hanging from nothing falls with them.
 *
 * Three modes:
 *
 *   CLASSIC    endless. Every few shots that burst nothing, a new row comes
 *              in from the top and the board gets closer to the line.
 *   LEVELS     a board to clear. The ceiling comes DOWN instead, and the
 *              level you reach is kept.
 *   TIMED      two minutes. The rows come by the clock, not by your misses.
 *
 * The file layout is Topos's, and for the same reason -the rules and the
 * drawing are tested without a screen (tools/bb_harness.c)-:
 *
 *   bb_pixel.c   pixel engine and dirty rectangles (from topos, via cjump)
 *   bb_art.c     the bubbles: one lit sphere map, a palette per colour
 *   bb_game.c    rules, aiming, physics and levels. Neither LVGL nor the HAL.
 *   bb_draw.c    backdrop, board, and the compositor that repaints only what
 *                changed
 *   burbujas.c   the app: LVGL screens, preferences, touch, timer, sound
 *
 * THE ONLY TEXT ON THE CANVAS IS NUMBERS AND SIGNS. The 5x7 font has no
 * accents; every word is an LVGL label wrapped in _(). That is Claude Jump's
 * rule and it is what keeps the catalogues free of transliterations.
