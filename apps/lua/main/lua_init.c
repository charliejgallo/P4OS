/*
 * Replaces Lua's linit.c: the same luaL_openlibs(), with the list of
 * libraries that are actually on board.
 *
 * Missing, on purpose, and each one for a reason:
 *   io       there is one filesystem, the microSD, and a script gets to it
 *            through the 'aos' binding, not through fopen on any path.
 *   os       os.execute, os.exit and os.tmpname on a board with no shell;
 *            the clock comes from the HAL instead, which knows about the RTC
 *            and the timezone.
 *   package  require() loads .so files: that is the loader we are trying to
 *            get away from.
 *   debug    setmetatable on anything and raw access to upvalues: it undoes
 *            any sandbox built above it.
 *
 * Their sources are not copied into lua/ either, so this is not a switch
 * somebody can flip by accident: the code is not in the binary.
