-- The other way of drawing: nothing is cleared and nothing is erased either.
--
-- build() paints the world once -a grid, which is the point: it is DRAWN, not
-- a flat colour- and calls aos.background() to freeze it. From then on the app
-- undoes each frame at the start of the next one, copying those rectangles
-- back from the frozen copy, so draw() only ever has to draw. Erasing by
-- painting over with the background colour, which is what this script did
-- before there was a background, would leave rectangular holes in the grid.
--
-- What it costs is what the balls cover: every primitive marks the box it
-- touches and only those boxes are scaled onto the screen. The line at the
-- top says how many rows and pixels that was in the last frame, out of the
-- whole canvas; cubo.lua is the opposite -it calls aos.clear() every frame,
-- so everything is dirty- and both are right.
--
-- P4OS: eight balls on the whole screen, and resize() builds the world again
-- when the screen turns: the frozen background is the old shape, so the app
-- drops it, and the balls are kept inside the new field.
