/*
 * P4OS (from AmoledOS) - Cameras: RTP packets back into what the decoders eat.
 *
 * H.264 (RFC 6184): single NAL units, STAP-A aggregates and FU-A fragments
 * become one Annex-B NAL unit each (00 00 00 01 + NAL), handed on as soon as
 * it is whole. A fragment that arrives after a gap is dropped with the rest
 * of its NAL: the decoder resynchronises by itself at the next keyframe.
 *
 * JPEG (RFC 2435): the camera sends only the entropy-coded scan, plus a
 * type, a quality factor and sometimes the quantisation tables. The JPEG
 * headers the decoder needs (DQT, SOF0, DHT, SOS) are rebuilt here from the
 * RFC's reference tables, exactly as the RFC's appendix does.
