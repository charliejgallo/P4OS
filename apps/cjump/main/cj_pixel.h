/*
 * CLAUDE JUMP - pixel art engine with dirty rectangles
 *
 * Copied from apps/arkanos/main/ak_pixel.c with the names changed. It is code
 * proven on the board and there is no point rewriting it; what follows
 * explains why it also works for a game that scrolls, which is not obvious.
 *
 * The game is drawn into a small RGB565 canvas, 240 px wide and as tall as
 * the screen allows at x3: 240x426 standing up (720x1278, the whole portrait
 * screen) and 240x240 lying down (720x720, centred between the two button
 * columns). It is the OS's retro canvas (aos_retro.h), which scales it x3 (by
 * hardware on the board) and only over the rectangles the game presents.
 *
 * The second half of the problem is how much gets repainted. In 2043 the whole
 * background moves, so the entire screen has to be upscaled and invalidated on
 * every frame: 165 thousand pixels of upscaling plus 165 thousand of LVGL
 * drawing, that is, 15 fps.
 *
 * A jumping game is vertical and scrolls, so it looks like 2043's case and not
 * arkanos's. The way out is in the game's design: THE BACKGROUND DOES NOT
 * SCROLL. The sky, the clouds and the stars are fixed in screen coordinates
 * -it is what the original Doodle Jump does with its squared paper- and the
 * only things that move as the camera climbs are the platforms, the critter
 * and the objects. With that the work per frame is a handful of small
 * rectangles and not the whole screen.
 *
 * Hence the two buffers and the dirty list:
 *
 *   bg    the sky and its decorations. It is rebuilt only on changing zone.
 *   fb    the frame on screen. It starts as a copy of bg.
 *
 * And per frame:
 *
 *   1. restore from bg into fb the rectangles we dirtied last frame
 *   2. draw what moves, recording each rectangle
 *   3. upscale into big and invalidate ONLY the union of the two sets
 *
 * Everything that moves records ONE rectangle enclosing its old position and
 * its new one, so a platform descending 9 px with the scroll costs 30x15 and
 * not two separate rectangles.
 *
 * A design consequence worth bearing in mind: any effect touching the whole
 * screen (a shake moving the canvas, a global flash, an animated background, a
 * scrolling sky) throws all of this away. That is why the zone change -which
 * does repaint the whole background- is one expensive frame every few hundred
 * metres and not something continuous.
