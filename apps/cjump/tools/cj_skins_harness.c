/*
 * Test bench for Claude Jump's costumes.
 *
 * Draws all sixteen in a grid and writes a PPM. It needs neither LVGL, nor the
 * HAL, nor the simulator: it is cj_pixel.c and cj_skins.c and nothing else. It
 * serves two different purposes and both matter:
 *
 *   1. Looking at all sixteen together, which is the only way to see whether
 *      any of them is lost against the background or whether two came out too
 *      similar.
 *   2. VERIFYING THAT NONE OF THEM RUNS OUTSIDE HERO_BOX_*. Each costume is
 *      drawn onto a canvas larger than its box, with the box painted a
 *      sentinel colour; if on finishing a pixel has been drawn outside the box,
 *      the program says so with its coordinates and exits with an error. That
 *      is the defect that on the board shows up as a trail stuck on the screen,
 *      and that by looking at the game is indistinguishable from a badly
 *      recorded dirty rectangle.
